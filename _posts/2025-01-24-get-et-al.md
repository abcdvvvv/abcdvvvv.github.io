1. **`get`**  
   - **Scope**：Generally used to retrieve values from indexable data structures (such as `Dict`, `Array`) or other containers with customizable interfaces.  
   - **Function**：`get(collection, key, default)` will attempt to retrieve the value for `key` from `collection`. If the value is not found, `default` will be returned.
   - **Example**：  
     ```julia
     d = Dict(:a => 1, :b => 2)
     println(get(d, :a, 0))  # 1
     println(get(d, :c, 0))  # 0 (Due to :c not existing)
     ```  
   - **Application**：When there is no guarantee that a key will always exist, you can gracefully provide a default value and avoid throwing an error.

2. **`getproperty`**  
   - **Scope**：This is the underlying mechanism for attribute access* in Julia, which is mainly related to **dot notation syntax (`.`)**.  
   - **Function**：When we use the `obj.someproperty` syntax on an object `obj`, Julia will call `getproperty(obj, :someproperty)` to get the property. You can also define/override the `Base.getproperty` method in your custom types to execute some custom logic when accessing properties (such as lazy loading, redirecting to other fields, calculating virtual properties, etc.).  
   - **Example**：  
     ```julia
     struct MyType
         x::Int
     end

     function Base.getproperty(m::MyType, sym::Symbol)
         if sym === :y
             return m.x + 1
         else
             return getfield(m, sym)  # fallback to default field access
         end
     end

     m = MyType(10)
     println(m.x)  # Actual call getproperty(m, :x) -> getfield(m, :x)
     println(m.y)  # Actual call getproperty(m, :y) -> Custom logic returns 11
     ```  
   - **Application**：Intercept and dynamically handle access to the properties of structures/objects. For example, properties that are “calculated” rather than actually stored can be made to be accessed like normal fields by overriding `getproperty`.

3. **`getfield`**  
   - **Scope**：This is the function for *directly accessing the fields of a structure* in Julia.
   - **Function**：`getfield(obj, :fieldname)` is **low-level** access to a field of a structure and does not trigger the overriding logic of `getproperty`. In other words, it just “gets the actual field in the object” and does not execute additional custom methods.  
   - **Example**：  
     ```julia
     struct MyType
         x::Int
     end

     m = MyType(10)
     println(getfield(m, :x))  # 10
     ```  
   - **Application**：Use `getfield` when you need to bypass any possible `getproperty` overloads or when you explicitly want to access the fields of the underlying structure directly. For example, in a custom implementation of `getproperty`, `getfield` is often used to get the actual field value.

### Summary

- **`get`** is a high-level "safe" getter function for data structures that provides default values to handle missing keys.  
- **`getproperty`** is the mechanism behind the dot syntax (`.`), allowing users to customize property access behavior through overloading. 
- **`getfield`** is the lowest-level function that directly accesses the fields of a structure without any overloading. It is generally only explicitly called when writing low-level code or customizing `getproperty`.
