The *Jacobian-Free Newton–Krylov (JFNK)* method is a nonlinear solver that combines Newton’s method with Krylov-subspace linear solvers *without ever forming the Jacobian matrix explicitly*.

At each Newton iteration we solve the linear system
$$
J(x^k)\,\delta x = -F(x^k)
$$

using a Krylov method (e.g. GMRES). Rather than assembling \(J\), JFNK approximates Jacobian–vector products $J(x)v$ via finite differences:

$$
J(x)\,v \approx \frac{F(x + \varepsilon\,v) - F(x)}{\varepsilon},
$$

with a small \(\varepsilon\). This “matrix-free” approach reduces memory and computational cost when \(J\) is large or expensive to form, and allows reuse of existing residual-evaluation code. Preconditioning can still be applied by approximating \(J\) or its inverse action. JFNK is widely used in large-scale simulations (e.g., fluid dynamics, reactive flows) where explicit Jacobian assembly would be prohibitive.
